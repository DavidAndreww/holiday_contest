# Holiday Code Challenge

Webpage reconstruction challenge! Re-create the static webpage below. You must use your own code, no Bootstrap. You can pull the text sizes and font styles from the page source, but all padding, margins and general display must be your own. I use the ColorZilla chrome extension to get coor hex codes. 

## Grading
Whoever uses the FEWEST lines of code, wins. That is all. Layout of the page will be considered, and must be fairly precise, but not an exact match. Everything between the <body> tags of the HTML file, and all CSS (excluding comments) will be counted. The spacing inbetween lines in your syntax will not be considered in total count. General syntactic guidelines and best practices must be followed (i.e. no cramming font color, height, width and border color all onto one line in your CSS. No tricky shit or shortcuts. 
  
 ## Instructions
 Fork && Clone this repository. 
 The HTML/CSS file is set up for you, and the single image used on the website is also included in this repo.

 I haven't sorted out a submission method. Just rocket chat me the URL for your github repository. 
  
  ## Model Site
  This is the site to be reconstructed:  shorturl.at/wFU09
  
  ## Prize
  Cash. Benjamin Frankin. Ok, probably not, but....I don't really feel like going to the bank. In reality, it will probably just be five    Andrew Jacksons. 

Good Luck.
